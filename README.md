# translatorYamlToGro
This is an app that it translates Yaml files if these yaml files comply with the specification that is require in order to make
experiments in Gro
The first one in the bar tools is Archive. 
In Archive you can open yaml document and
see it in the app
You also save yaml document if you did changes
Finally you can close the app

On the other hand you can verify if the yaml document is correct 
because there is a push button called "check if it is correct"
If it is not correct, the wrongs will be shown in the 
app and if it is correct you can translate it to gro pushing in 
the button "Translate to gro".

Finally you can save gro document where you want in
the button "Save gro file in..."
